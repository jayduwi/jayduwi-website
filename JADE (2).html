		<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
		<p>My full name is Jade Louie M. Lalu; however, most people call me by my nicknames, such as Jade, Louie, Hiyas, or Jay Uwi. I came from the town of Mapaniqui in Candaba, Pampanga. My family is small but close-knit, as it consists of only four people: my father, Jeffrey M. Lalu, my mother, Lory M. Lalu, my younger brother, Jelo Maverick M. Lalu, and myself. My motto has always been "you can’t control the wind, but you can adjust your sail," reminding me that you can’t control the things around you, but it’s the way you react and decide what you will do to go with it.

		<h1>THINGS THAT I LIKE</h1>
		<p>I enjoy a variety of activities, such as listening to Bini and Blackpink. I cherish the idea of having a pet cat to keep me company. Night rides thrill me as I soak in the serene darkness. I dream of hiking somewhere with my friends.I love going to the beach because it makes me feel at peace. I love dancing and strumming the ukulele, and I sometimes dream of rocking out on the electric guitar. Though my singing voice may resemble "kalderong pinukpukpok," the joy it brings me is unmatched. I want to jog, and embarking on nature trips with my family are moments I want to experience. My ultimate goals include paving the path to success, supporting my family, fulfilling their dreams, and exploring the wonders of the world through travel.

		<h1>FAVORITE</h1>
		<p>One of the activities that brings me the most joy is crafting beautiful memories that I can cherish throughout my life. Whether it's embarking on nature trips to soak in the wonders of the natural world, enjoying delightful outings with my beloved family members to create precious bonding moments, or relishing exciting adventures with my close friends that become timeless treasures, each experience adds a color to my life. These moments hold a special place in my heart as they capture the essence of happiness, laughter, and love. Looking ahead, I eagerly anticipate growing older with an array of unforgettable memories that I can fondly reminisce about, sharing tales of joy and excitement from my escapades with those who have journeyed alongside me. In the end, it's the memories we cultivate that truly define the richness of our lives and offer a comforting anchor in the passage of time.
